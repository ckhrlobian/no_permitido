# The Goal
{: .no_toc }


This page is dedicated to a finding within the chapter of my Master’s thesis titled, “El Negro _No_ Permitido: Black as Apolitical”.  This section explores the ways in which black people were not thought of to have collective political knowledge in the 1970s, a time when the negritudes movement was officially coming to fruition.  The negritudes movement was comprised of  heterogeneous groups of mostly black intellectuals, politicians, university students, and professionals in larger urban cities such as Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali, which aimed at visibilizing the inequality of Colombia’s black population by claiming institutional systems were racist.  Many of their claims were disavowed and mocked in the press at the time, but are now officially recognized by the constitutional change of 1991 which describes the country as  multicultural and pluriethnic, with specific provisions to protect vulnerable indigenous and black Pacific communities.  However, the implementation of these provisions have been criticized by many scholars and activists who claim the government is not doing nearly enough to protect these areas from privatization and still regarding these zones as peripheral and even, abandoned.

This page will have a cross examination of two newspapers’ coverage of the same events: the First National Meeting of Black Populations in 1975 and the First Congress of Black Culture in the Americas in 1977. These congresses were significant in the sense that they were one of the rare occasions of black mobilization which gained space in the press, and its coverage reveals the discriminatory attitudes of mestizo elites in both the capital, Bogotá through _El Tiempo_, and the southwest city, Cali, through _El País_. The goal of this analysis is to understand both the implicit and explicit ways that black people have faced discrimination, and how narratives have been constructed about black mobilization which fits neatly into recycled stereotypes and stigmas of being black in Colombia.
