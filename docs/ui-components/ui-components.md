# About

Hello everyone!

My name is Christine Khrlobian and I am a MA candidate in the Latin American and Iberian Studies program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Dr. Cecilia Méndez (History Professor and LAIS director). What drove me to this program was its interdisciplinary approach which has given me the privilege to work with talented and dedicated students and professors across the social sciences. This program has also allowed me to pursue my research interests in social, cultural, and political dynamics of Latin America from the colonial era to the 20th century, and how these processes connect in an international scope to the United States, Europe, and Africa.
My current research challenges myths of racial democracy in Colombia in the mid-late 20th century by analyzing print and visual media in a national and local scope. My goal is to gain an understanding of how racial stereotypes were presented in newspapers and other medias, how narratives of Afro-Colombians were constructed, and how some individuals of African descent fought against the stigma of these representations. The thesis is entitled, “_El Negro Permitido_: Representations of Black Bodies and Beings in the Colombian Press, 1970-1980”.
