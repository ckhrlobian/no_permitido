It was during the 1960s and 70s which marked the “incubation” period of what will become the Black Social Movement in Colombia. Leaders from the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, as well as from the large urban centers of Cali, Medellín, and Bogotá, joined together in an effort to organize, deliberate, and protest racist policies and negligence from central and local governments.  These racist policies manifested in mainly rural areas in the form of international and national exploitation of lands mainly occupied by Afrodescendant communities, little to no access to healthcare and educational opportunities, as well as the unreachable access to land titling and security.  It was also during this decade, which saw the fruition of the study of negritude in the country.  In the 1970s, black social leaders were very much inspired by the civil rights movement in the United States, the writings of Frantz Fanon, Amílcar Cabral, Patricio Lumumba, Nelson Mandela, and Marcus Garvey, Black South Africans’ protests to apartheid, as well as the independence revolutions in various parts of Africa leading up to the 1970s.  They were connected to the global Pan-Africanist Movement of the time, and participated in conferences and important events of a rising black consciousness around the world.  

The <b>Primer Encuentro Nacional de la Población Negra Colombiana</b> (The First Colombian National Meeting of Black Populations) took place on February 21st, 1975 and culminated on the 23rd in Cali, Colombia.  This was the first national meeting to officially discuss and draft a conclusion of the immediate needs and future goals of Colombia’s black population. The council was headed by Valentín Moreno Salazar (President) and Genaro Bonilla Perlazo, including the board of directors John Herbert Valencia Boat (Vice President), Adelina Abadía Villegas (Fiscal), Luis Enrique Dinas Sape (Treasurer), Carlos A. Vallecilla (Secretary), as well as Amir Smith Córdoba and Francisco Valencia as members.  The major concerns brought forth at this meeting were discussing avenues to <b>end racial discrimination</b> in the country, create equitable opportunities for  black people to gain more access to education (especially higher education), systems of health and infrastructure, and strive to politicize their cause to the greatest extent in order to implement these measures in local and central governments.

Most of the 183 delegates were students, intellectuals, and professionals (mostly lawyers) who lived in larger urban cities, therefore the point of discussion mainly focused on black people in urban areas of the country, and not necessarily more rural or coastal areas who had immediate needs which pertained to issues of illegal land seizure, violence, the armed conflict, and access to health systems and good infrastructure mainly to help with transporting farmer’s agricultural goods for sale.  Due to the daily interactions these professionals and academics had with light-skinned members of the country in the capital, Medellín, and other large cities, they experienced first-hand how racial discrimination could deter their chances of success, and how national policies did not address these systemic issues.  


Catching the fire, other groups emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s such as <b>Cimarrón</b> in Popayán (formerly known as SOWETO), <b>Hasta Tabala</b> in Tunja, as well as a chapter of The <b>Panteras Negras</b> (Black Panthers) and <b>Musulmanes Negras</b> (Black Muslims) in Buenaventura. This particular sect of Islam in Colombia was inspired by the teachings of the Nation of Islam in the United States, spearheaded for some time by Malcolm X, who preached power and dignity as the foundation of black consciousness. Groups also emerged in rural areas of the Pacific, but were more associated with indigenous and campesino organizations advocating for land rights and other issues on a local level.  Therefore, the Black Social Movement was not one homogenous group with a common goal, rather a conglomerate of multiple organizations with their respected socio-cultural and regional bases. These struggles of dignity and social welfare prompted many Afrodescendant professionals and intellectuals to gather, in what became known as the First National Meeting of Black Populations in 1975.

_El País’s_ stories about the National Congresses were notably different from _El Tiempo’s_ single article.  As the Primer Encuentro was to take place in the paper’s publishing city, Cali, there was an extensive account dedicated to each day of the conference.  The first headline, <b>“Nunca hemos recibido apoyo”</b> (We never received help [from the government] ) and the tone of the article, is more inclusive of the organizer’s voices, and sympathetic to the issues the conference raised.  The article published on the first day of the conference, February 21st, was more of an interview which allowed two of the organizers, Valentín Moreno and Iván Forbes Bohorquez, to comment extensively about the goal of the three-day congress and what they felt black people in the country faced as their largest obstacles in getting ahead in life.  One such explanation is as follows:

<b>"</b>The government has never been concerned about people of color <b>[los de color]</b>, does not allow them to emerge. Surreptitiously, slyly, we are made to be victims of racial division, of course this is not seen in a black manuel-laborer <b>[obrero]</b>, in a black female cook <b>[negra cocinera]</b>, in any black employee who occupies lower positions, the division is made when a black intellectual emerges, and he feels able to occupy a position within the government, their intellectual capacities are no longer seen, they are fixed only on the color of their skin. When has an ambassador or black consul been appointed? Up to the present we have not had a black occupying such exclusive positions of whites.<b>"</b>

It is clear in this statement, that the organizers are openly criticizing the racist system which disavows more than the two or three exceptional cases, for black Colombians to have equal access to positions of power in all sectors of society.  They bring forward the acceptance of black people as mostly occupying subordinate positions in society, but not given the capacity to cross-over to spaces deemed exclusive to mestizos and whites.  It is also made clear that they are not organizing the conference simply to discuss the current situation of black Colombians, but to offer a political response to these problems.  At the end of the meeting, the Colombian National Council of Black Populations (Consejo Nacional de la Población Negra Colombiana) was formed, and the delegates decided to put Juan Zapata Olivella, brother to acclaimed Afrocolombian scholar and activist, Manuel Zapata Olivella, as a liberal presidential candidate in the following year’s elections.

Two years after the Primer Encuentro spearheaded by Valentín Moreno Salazar, a second congress took place in the same city of Cali from August 24th-28th.  This congress was called the Primer Congreso de la Cultura Negra de las Américas (First Congress of Black Culture in the Americas).  Just from the title, “culture” and how it will be debated and shaped throughout this conference, was the focus rather than on racial discrimination and political disenfranchisement in the Primer Encuentro.  Manuel Zapata Olivella with his organization, el Fundación de Estudios Folclóricos (the Foundation of the Study of Folklore) was the head organizer of this congress which boasted an international scope of Pan-Africanist scholars and activists such as Brazilian professor, Abdias Do Nascimento, from the State University of <b>New York</b> in Buffalo, representative of the African Culture of the Diaspora Project in <b>Nigeria</b>, Wande Abimbola, Cesar Fernandez Moreno, director of <b>UNESCO</b> in the Caribbean (based in Havana), Mohamed El-Khasindars, delegate of <b>Egypt</b> who read a statement from President Sadat, Norman E. Whitten, anthropologist from the <b>United States</b> amongst others, representative from the Organization of American States (OAS) Valerie McCormie, as well as other prominent intellectuals from <b>Chile</b>, <b>Costa Rica</b>, <b>Ecuador</b>, <b>Honduras</b>, <b>Mexico</b>, <b>Panama</b>, <b>Peru</b>, <b>Puerto Rico</b>, <b>Venezuela</b>, <b>Spain</b>, and <b>Senegal</b>.  Among the Colombian intellectuals who attended were some of the most renowned scholars of the theme, including figures such as ethnologist, Rogelio Velásquez, poets Helcías Martán Góngora and Jorge Artel, Ricardo Cros, Aquiles Escalante, anthropologists Nina S. de Friedemann and Jaime Arocha, acclaimed folklorist and dancer Delia Zapata Olivella (sister of Manuel Zapata Olivella), historian Nancy Motta Gonzalez amongst many others.

The main goal of the congress was to create a global dialogue about how culture in the articulation of food, music, dance, dress, religion, amongst other expressions, had “raíces del África” (roots from Africa) by trying to “find the origin and the identity of the communities of people of color” (...trata de buscar el origen y la identidad de los pueblos de raza de color...) in order to foster a sense of dignity amongst Afrodescendant individuals.  The second major topic of the congress was how to visibilize Africa’s presence through these expressions and its influence on the development of the American nations.

## Color schemes
{: .d-inline-block }

New
{: .label .label-green }

Just the Docs supports two color schemes: light (default), and dark.

To enable a color scheme, set the `color_scheme` parameter in your site's `_config.yml` file:

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
# Color scheme currently only supports "dark" or nil (default)
color_scheme: "dark"
```
<button class="btn js-toggle-dark-mode">Preview dark color scheme</button>

<script>
const toggleDarkMode = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-dark-mode')
const cssFile = document.querySelector('[rel="stylesheet"]')
const originalCssRef = cssFile.getAttribute('href')
const darkModeCssRef = originalCssRef.replace('just-the-docs.css', 'dark-mode-preview.css')

addEvent(toggleDarkMode, 'click', function(){
  if (cssFile.getAttribute('href') === originalCssRef) {
    cssFile.setAttribute('href', darkModeCssRef)
  } else {
    cssFile.setAttribute('href', originalCssRef)
  }
})
</script>

## Specific visual customization

To customize your site’s aesthetic, open `_sass/custom/custom.scss` in your editor to see if there is a variable that you can override. Most styles like fonts, colors, spacing, etc. are derived from these variables. To override a specific variable, uncomment its line and change its value.

For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, open `_sass/custom/custom.css` and find the `$link-color` variable on line `50`. Uncomment it, and change its value to our `$blue-000` variable, or another shade of your choosing.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```scss
// ...
//
// $body-text-color: $grey-dk-100;
// $body-heading-color: $grey-dk-300;
$link-color: $blue-000;
//
// ...
```

_Note:_ Editing the variables directly in `_sass/support/variables.scss` is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail.
