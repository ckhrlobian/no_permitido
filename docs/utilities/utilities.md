# The Press

Both newspapers in this thesis, _El Tiempo_ and _El País_, were known to have strong political ties.
to one party or another because both presses were owned by families heavily involved in the political arena.  Until 2012, _El Tiempo_ had been run and operated in the highest positions by members of the Santos family: producing four presidents, Joaquín Camacho (1814) and Clímaco Calderón (1882), both men related through the maternal side of Santos Calderón, Eduardo Santos who served from 1938-1942, and more recently, Juan Manuel Santos, who’s administration ran from 2010-2018 and was responsible for signing the Peace Deals with the head of Leftist guerilla group, the FARC. The family has also had one vice president, Francisco Santos (2002-2010).   An article by _El Espectador_, recounted how by the early 20th century, the two brothers, Enrique and Eduardo Santos, “consolidated the most influential media in the country and with the help of other equally important newspapers such as _Republican Gazette_, _El Liberal_, and _El Espectador_, constituted the platform of the liberal press that put an end to the conservative hegemony in 1930.”  Eight years later, Eduardo Santos was elected President of the Republic. Luis Fernando Santos, brother of former president, Juan Manuel Santos, worked in the editorial office and became the head of production and manager of the paper between 1972 and 1996, in which he was appointed president until his retirement in 2010.  The Santos family are aligned with the Liberal political party, and historically, have used El Tiempo as a means to propagate stories within this perspective and even as a vehicle to promote personal and political ambitions as well as the presidencies of candidates the family was aligned with, though the paper itself says it is more centrist leaning.

_El País_, on the other hand, has a Conservative affiliation, and was owned by Álvaro Lloreda Caicedo, a successful businessman and political leader of Valle del Cauca. The paper began its operations in 1950, and still holds the first spot in regional news of the South West.  Lloreda’s influence in the capital of Valle del Cauca, Cali, and the political realm of the country ran deep.  He was elected mayor of Cali in the 1950s, and was also a member of Congress serving both in the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, and in 1974, was appointed as Ambassador of Colombia to Spain.  A 2002 article in _El Tiempo_ described Lloreda’s business group, Pacific Group (Grupo Pacífico) as “one of the most serious business conglomerates in the country” in the 1990s. He was reported to have kept his business ventures, including the newspaper, within natural and legal family members, in order to maintain utmost control of these operations.  In 1998, he was known to have sold 8,160 shares of the Modern Press (Press Moderno) to “one of his relatives, who in turn sold them to another family member.  The latter closed the circle by selling them back to Alvaro José Lloredo.”  

I delve into these brief histories of _El País_ and _El Tiempo_ because it is imperative to understand the power structures of the press in Colombia, and how one family can have so much of an influence of popular ideas and narratives through the ownership of a leading paper. Colombian historian and journalist, Jorge Orlando Melo, has recounted the significance of the press in promulgating ideas and political candidates in the country, by recounting how, “the very birth of the Republic was accompanied by loud voices of public authors.  Antonio Nariño used his newspapers to topple and change presidents and Simón Bolívar, after having founded The Orinoco Post, said that the press was ‘as useful as war supplies’, and used her like a kind of ‘artillery of thought’”.  Although this research focuses on the 1970s, similar forms of the press as privately owned operations to promote specific social, political, and economic ideas in the country are nothing new, just refashioned to fit in their respective eras.  

When I unpack representations of black individuals and racialized geographies in _El País_ and _El Tiempo_, it must be foregrounded with this knowledge of how the press has operated in Colombia.  Therefore, speaking of not only social discrimination but how some of these representations of blacks are actually remnants of systemic racism in the country is not accidental.  Since racism is exercised with power, the press with all of its influence in the country can be interpreted as promulgating tacit or explicit forms of racism and not just prejudice or normalization of black inferiority. This thesis attempts to manifest these larger, systemic issues of racial anxieties present in the country, at a time when both newspapers were scapegoating the problem to the United States or of some African countries in their fight for independence.
